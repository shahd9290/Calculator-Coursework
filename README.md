# CS2800: Calculator Coursework
## October 2023 - December 2023

This assignment had me develop a calculator application, following Test Driven Development.

The calculator supports Standard and Reverse Polish expressions, and comes with a Terminal and GUI View.

The Interface was provided to me for the assignment. My responsibility was to focus on the calculations through the use of different stacks and algorithms.
